*"Just get give bad people a red evil checkmark like it's an rpg"* - tweet I saw somewhere

**This has been my worst idea so far. Please move along.**

Simple Firefox extensions that adds a red checkmark to *all evil people* on Twitter. (Note: I don't really think they're evil, I just thought the idea I read in that guy's tweet was funny.)
